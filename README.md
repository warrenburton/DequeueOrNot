# DequeueOrNot

Investigation into what dequeuing tableview cells does in a modern iOS environment. 

Inspired by a conversation in the comments of [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56525434/list-view-really-slow-and-laggy?noredirect=1#comment99991829_56525434) about lagginess in SwiftUI Lists I constructed a test harness to figure out what the effects of dequeing cells in a UITableView are.
